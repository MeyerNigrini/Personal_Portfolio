  export const karatePar: string = "I started practicing karate when I was just 4 years old, and it quickly became a huge part of my life. I trained in Shotokan Karate at my local dojo, where I dedicated myself to improving and eventually earned my black belt in 2016. That year, I had the incredible opportunity to travel to Japan, the birthplace of karate, to complete my black belt certification. It was an unforgettable experience, training with some of the most respected senseis in the world. Over the years, I competed in several regional and national tournaments, winning numerous medals, and attending international seminars. Though I don’t train as intensely now, karate still holds a special place in my heart, and I occasionally participate in local competitions when I can."
